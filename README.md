## Code of the sprints (front-end)

![](https://github.com/esztermazi/code-of-the-sprints-front-end/blob/master/src/static/img/DarkThemeLogo.png)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Technologies used:

⚬ [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)</br>
⚬ [React](https://reactjs.org/)</br>
⚬ [JavaScript](https://devdocs.io/javascript/)</br>
⚬ [React-Speech-Kit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-speech-kit)</br>
⚬ [React-Tree-Graph](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-tree-graph)</br>
⚬ [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)</br>
⚬ [Styled components](https://styled-components.com/)</br>

This repository contains the Frontend for the website called Code of the Sprints. It is one of my pet projects which aims to simulate a training during your first weeks at a new company in an entertaining way.

It is a personal learning progress management web application with extra tools from the amazing world of [Tolkien's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien) fantasy-novel series, [The Lord of the Rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings). Users are only able to login if they can resolve the riddle at the welcome site by using voice recognition.

They have to choose an avatar on the index page, after that they are free to start their journey.

They can personalize it more by select a theme:
⚬ [Shire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shire)</br>
⚬ [Mordor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mordor)</br>
⚬ [Gondor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gondor)</br>

They are also able to view the chosen team related tribe or family hierarchy trough animated graphs.

On the Profile page they can view movie quotes and some attributes regarding their chosen avatar.

### Future plans

#### OrkEnd

The main menu contains free work-task related games which gives the best practice to a newcomer to adapt the rules and policies regarding his/her position while he/she do not have access to all of the needed softwares or the senior colleagues are busy at the moment or just to have fun.

#### BagEnd

The contacts page with the graphs and the profile will have 2 functionalities: data manipulation from a separated BackEnd project with the user's company details and Lord of the Rings related info from the FrontEnd side.
They are also able to view the company team hierarchy and see through the system with the help of the animated graphs. The profile page will also represent company related info as well, with the user's company-related attributes. There will be a high score page where they can follow their progress how much point they gained in the games. When they gain a certain point it means their quality reaches the expected level. If their quality is outstanding then they can get a gold star([leaf of Lorien](https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Leaves_of_Lorien)), as well , as [Aragorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aragorn) said: "Not idly do the leaves of Lorien fall".

### Motivations for building this project:

Familiarize myself and deepen my knowledge in various FrontEnd technologies and libraries (React, JavaScript, CSS, Styled-Components) and experimenting with the [LOTR API](https://the-one-api.herokuapp.com/documentation). Also to make a gift to my previous colleagues about my last workplace which gave the idea to build this project.
